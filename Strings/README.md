# Strings

Algorithm exercises based on string manipulation and character data structures.

---

## Algorithms covered

- Fizz Buzz (LeetCode #412)
- First Unique Character in a String (LeetCode #387)
- Valid Palindrome (LeetCode #125)
- Reverse String (LeetCode #344)
- Longest Word in a String
- Valid Anagram (LeetCode #242)
- Rotate String (LeetCode #796)

---

## Concepts practiced

- String traversal
- Character frequency counting
- Two Pointers technique
- Hash Maps
- String normalization
- In-place operations

---

## Languages

- TypeScript (main)
- Python (selected exercises)

Each file contains a standalone solution.

---

## Complexity

Solutions are optimized for performance:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1) or O(n) depending on the problem

---

## Notes

- Files are named using **camelCase** (e.g. `isPalindrome.ts`)
- One problem per file
