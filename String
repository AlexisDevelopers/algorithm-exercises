## Strings

Algorithm exercises based on string manipulation and character data structures.

### Algorithms covered

* **Fizz Buzz** (LeetCode #412)
* **First Unique Character in a String** (LeetCode #387)
* **Valid Palindrome** (LeetCode #125)
* **Reverse String** (LeetCode #344)
* **Longest Word in a String**

### Notes

* Each file contains a standalone solution in TypeScript.
* Files are named using **camelCase** (e.g., `isPalindrome.ts`).
* Solutions are optimized for time complexity, focusing on techniques like **Two Pointers** and **Hash Maps**.
