# Strings

Algorithm exercises focused on **string manipulation**, **character-level data structures**, and classic **coding interview patterns**.

This folder is part of a structured Data Structures & Algorithms repository, organized by topic for systematic interview preparation.

---

## Scope

The exercises in this folder cover problems where strings are treated as:

- Arrays of characters in memory
- Immutable data structures (depending on language)
- Inputs for frequency counting, pointer manipulation, and pattern matching

The solutions emphasize:

- Linear-time algorithms
- Constant or minimal extra space
- Clear reasoning suitable for live coding interviews

---

## Algorithms & Patterns Covered

- Two Pointers  
- Hash Maps / Frequency Counters  
- String Traversal  
- Character Normalization  
- Sliding Window (foundational concepts)

---

## Exercises Included

| Problem | LeetCode |
|------|---------|
| Fizz Buzz | #412 |
| First Unique Character in a String | #387 |
| Valid Palindrome | #125 |
| Reverse String | #344 |
| Longest Word in a String | — |
| Valid Anagram | #242 |
| Rotate String | #796 |

---

## Languages

- **TypeScript** (primary)
- **Python** 

Each file contains a standalone solution with no external dependencies.

---

## Complexity Guarantees

All solutions are written with explicit complexity targets:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n) when required by the problem

Complexity annotations are included directly in the source files.

---

## Naming Conventions

- Files use **camelCase**
  - Example: `isPalindrome.ts`
- One problem per file
- Clear, interview-friendly function names
