# Linked Lists

Algorithm exercises based on singly linked list data structures and pointer manipulation.

---

## Algorithms covered

- Delete Node in a Linked List (LeetCode #237)
- Design Linked List (LeetCode #707)
- Linked List Cycle (LeetCode #141)
- Merge Two Sorted Lists (LeetCode #21)
- Remove Duplicates from Sorted List (LeetCode #83)
- Remove Linked List Elements (LeetCode #203)
- Remove Nth Node From End of List (LeetCode #19)
- Reverse Linked List (LeetCode #206)
- Reverse Linked List II (LeetCode #92)
- Swap Nodes in Pairs (LeetCode #24)

---

## Concepts practiced

- Node traversal
- Pointer manipulation
- Fast and slow pointers
- In-place list modification
- Dummy nodes
- Edge case handling (head removal, single-node lists)
- Iterative list processing

---

## Languages

- TypeScript (main)

Each file contains a standalone solution.

---

## Complexity

Solutions are optimized for performance:

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1) or O(n) depending on the problem

---

## Notes

- Files are named using **camelCase** (e.g. `removeNthFromEnd.ts`)
- One problem per file
- All implementations assume a standard singly linked list structure
