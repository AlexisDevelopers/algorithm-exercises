/**
 * LeetCode #141 - Linked List Cycle
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/
 * 
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * 
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached
 * again by continuously following the next pointer.
 * 
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * - -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 * - pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 * 
 * @time O(n) - Each node is visited at most once
 * @space O(1) - Only two pointers are used
