/**
 * LeetCode #33 - Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/
 * 
 * There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
 * Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot.
 * 
 * Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target,
 * return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1], target = 0
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 * - -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
 * - All values of nums are unique.
 * - nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
 * - -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
 * 
 * @time O(log n) - Binary search
 * @space O(1) - Constant extra space
 */

/**
 * Pattern used: Modified Binary Search
 * Core idea:
 * - One half (left or right) is always sorted.
 * - Decide which half is sorted, then check if target lies in that half.
 * - Move boundaries accordingly.

      if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
        right = mid - 1;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
